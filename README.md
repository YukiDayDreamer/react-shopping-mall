# React Shopping Mall

A project which extracts key features from [React-Shopping-Cart](https://github.com/jeffersonRibeiro/react-shopping-cart) by Jefferson Ribeiro.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Run `yarn start` to start the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

You will also need [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) to mock a REST API:

```sh
sudo npm i json-server -g
json-server assets/products.json --port=3001 --delay=500  
```
